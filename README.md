The State Challenge: Redux Store 

User Story:
1. AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
2. I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
3. SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem



Acceptance Criteria
1. GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state
2. WHEN I review the appâ€™s store
3. THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
4. WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store
5. THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider
6. WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
7. THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
8. WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store
9. THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
10. WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions
11. THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
